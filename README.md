•	XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
•	HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
•	XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are
XML Simplifies Things
•	It simplifies data sharing
•	It simplifies data transport
•	It simplifies platform changes
•	It simplifies data availability
The document type (DOCTYPE) declaration consists of an internal, or references an external Document Type Definition (DTD). It can also have a combination of both internal and external DTDs. The DTD defines the constraints on the structure of an XML document. It declares all of the document's element types , children element types, and the order and number of each element type. It also declares any attributes, entities, notations, processing instructions, comments, and PE references in the document.

A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters which identifies an Internet Resource.
The most common URI is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which identifies an Internet domain address. Another, not so common type of URI is the Uniform Resource Name (URN).
